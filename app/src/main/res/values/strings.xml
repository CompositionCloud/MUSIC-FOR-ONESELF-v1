    <string name="intro_text"><b><i>welcome to MUSIC FOR ONESELF v1!</i></b> this app
        consists of 23 short texts arranged in a modular fashion, that will guide you through a solitary
        and partially imagined musical experience around the Jazzcampus of the Musik-Akademie Basel,
        giving you instructions for where to go, what to listen to, and what to imagine, but also
        allowing you to create your own chain of events, your own imagined sound story. before you
        start, note that it is assumed that at the beginning you will be in the main corridor of
        floor -1. so, prepare yourself and click on the START NOW button below when you are ready.

    <string name="about_text"><b><i>MUSIC FOR ONESELF v1</i></b> was created by composer Goni Peles. it is
        part of <i>CompositionCloud</i>, a work in progress that can be briefly described as an abstract
        rhizomatic space containing different ideas to be used in modular ways to create art, mostly
        in the realms of sound and music, but not necessarily.
