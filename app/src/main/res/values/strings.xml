    <string name="intro_text">&lt;b>&lt;i>welcome to MUSIC FOR ONESELF v1!&lt;/i>&lt;/b> this app
        consists of 23 short texts arranged in a modular way, that will guide you through a solitary
        and partially imagined musical experience around the Jazzcampus of the Musik-Akademie Basel,
        giving you instructions for where to go, what to listen to and what to imagine, but also
        allowing you to create your own chain of events, your own imagined sound story. before you
        start, notice that it is assumed that at the beginning you will be in the main corridor of
        floor -1. so get prepared and click on the START NOW button below when you are ready.

    <string name="about_text"><b><i>MUSIC FOR ONESELF v1</i></b> is part of CompositionCloud, a work
        in progress by composer Goni Peles, which can be shortly described as an abstract rhizomatic
        space containing different ideas to be used in modular ways to create art, mostly in the
        realms of sound and music, but not necessarily.
